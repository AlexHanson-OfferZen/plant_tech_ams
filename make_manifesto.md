# Make: a Manifesto
[“We come together to get better at what we care about: making better software.”](https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about/footnotes?referrer=playlist-the_most_actionable_ted_talks)

Make is a community of software developers backed by [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/nl). OfferZen believes that true potential is unlocked when software developers are free to play with tech - hence the investment in building the Make community.

## What we believe
With Make, we aim to equip developers to create the next generation of software. To do this, we create more rounded developers, with a wider skill set, bigger resource base and more confidence to tackle things differently.

The starting point is our [Make event](https://github.com/OfferZen-Make/plant_tech_ams/blob/master/README.md#the-purpose-of-make) experience - which serves as an introdcution to the OfferZen Make Community.

## Guiding principles
Being founded in South-Africa, we have hosted over 60 [Make Days](https://makedays.offerzen.com/), and successfully built a community with 2500 makers. Make has learnt through rapid iteration that the best framework for developers to learn new technologies is by actually getting their hands dirty and building something with that tech. Make brings developers into the same room to build exciting projects together using the most exciting new technologies. Through this low-pressure collaborative experience, they learn a curated set of new technologies at an accelerated rate.

## The Plan

### Netherlands
Currently we're hosting 2 sessions a week. The goal is to create and offer a virtual environment where devs can play and develop their own IP in fields like machine learning, blockchain, and IoT, around concepts like image recognition, fleet/swarm control, computer vision, with hardware like Raspberry Pi’s, Arduino boards, and drones, Sphero’s, or other robots. 

### South Africa

Currently we're hosting 7 events a month, as part of the  [Programmable Banking Dev Community collaboration by OfferZen and Investec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcU0aT5ckDM&ab_channel=OfferZen). Although self-watering plants don't have much to do with Programmable Banking - it's a great way to focus the community members on having fun together and getting to know each other.

## We need you
To make the Make sessions a success, we need Makers just like you. You just need to be a somewhat experienced software developer in order to attend. We will give you the necessary tools to build a project with us and your fellow Makers, and you get to keep all of it. What we ask in return is for you to help us continuously iterate on Make, allowing us to make it a bit better every session. Also, please spread the word, so that we can grow our Make community and facilitate more people learning new things :)
